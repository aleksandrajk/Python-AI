# Image Classifier App using TensorFlow and Keras

The goal of this project is to provide a practical example of how to use TensorFlow and Keras to develop and train a simple image classification neural network. 

## Requirements
To run this app, you need to install the following libraries:
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

You can install them using pip:
```
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib

```
## Usage
This project serves as an example of how to train a simple image classification neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal of this project is to provide a practical example of how to use these tools to develop and train a basic model. The data used for training comes from the Keras fashion_images library, and the model is designed to classify images of clothing items into 10 different categories.

To use this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine and run the ImageClassifier.py script. The script will load the training and testing data, build and train the model, and then evaluate its performance on the testing data. You can adjust the hyperparameters of the model, such as the number of layers, the size of the filters, and the number of epochs, to experiment with different configurations and see how they affect the performance of the model.

Overall, this project is a great way to get started with image classification and machine learning in general. By exploring the code and experimenting with different configurations, you can learn a lot about the underlying principles of neural networks and how to use tools like TensorFlow and Keras to build and train your own models.
