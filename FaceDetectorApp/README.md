# Face Detector App using OpenCV

This is a simple face detection application built using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. The application uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in images or videos.

## Features
* Detects faces in images and videos
* Draws a bounding box around each detected face
* Can handle multiple faces in the same image or video


## Technologies Used
* Python
* OpenCV


## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone __'git clone https://github.com/aleksandrajk/Python-AI/tree/main/FaceDetectorApp.git'__.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running __'pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal'__.
3. Run the app by executing __'python FaceDetector.py'__ in your terminal.


## Usage
1. Open the app by running __'python FaceDetector.py'__.
2. Wait for the app to finish processing the file.
3. The processed file will be displayed on the app window with bounding boxes around the detected faces.


## Credits
The Haar Cascade classifier used in this application was trained using the OpenCV training module. Special thanks to the OpenCV community for providing the training tools and resources.
